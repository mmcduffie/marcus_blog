== Marcus' Blog Application

I wrote this blog app because I wanted my personal blog page to be unique, and didn’t want to pass up the opportunity to learn new things. Sure, I could have just put another Wordpress blog on my server. Or I could have used one of the blog apps that are written with Rails. However, I wouldn’t have learned anything, and I wouldn’t have the fine-grained control that comes with working with something you’ve created yourself. If you really want to, you are free to use my blog app for your own blog. Just be aware that it’s custom-coded to meet my needs, so it’s not going to have many features. The app only has the specific features that I wanted, because it is purpose-built for my webpage.
